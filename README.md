# The Poke APP

Netlify deployment: https://denis-mendoza-pokeapi.netlify.app/#/pokedex 

Welcome, to my poke api, in this readme I’ll be going over the why, the idea, the concept and the structure behind the app. 

First, the idea, building a fully responsive website using, react router, react redux and axios, to build my knowledge on authentication techniques and states global scope building methods. 

The concept: I based this on a “super easy to use and understand” UX with a very attractive UI.

The structure: 

First the user faces the “authentication” page, where it asks for a name to continue, without providing it, the app would not allow the user to visit the other pages. 

Second, user sees the “main” page, were he gets a welcome message, (top right hand corner) a menu to input a desire parameter to get information back based on it  (bottom right hand corner) or to filter the one that is already being shown on most of the left side of the page, with pagination options for when the specific items are too many to show in one page. 

Third, once the users, clicks on one of the preview items or enters a parameter, is taken to the next page, where the user either sees more “in depth” information about the item, or gets a “not found” message, giving the user the option of going back to the previous page.

Hope you enjoy the experience of using it.

Thank you.
